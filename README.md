This repository contains an analysis of data scraped from winemage.com. The original dataset can be found on kaggle.

## 1. INTRODUCTION
We are 7 students at IE University pursuing a Masters in Big Data and Business Analytics. 
We created this analysis as our final project for a course on statistical programming in R. 
As wine enthusiasts, we chose to analyze a Kaggle dataset on wine, consisting of 129,971 observations scraped from [WineEnthusiast](http://www.wineenthusiast.com) in the end of November 2017. 
We wanted to share some interesting facts on this dataset, and we hope you enjoy what we found.
